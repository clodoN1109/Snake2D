## The long-awaited follow-up to Tania Rascia's Snek.js, the ambitious terminal-based javascript implementaion of the snake game.
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/taniarascia/snek)](https://replit.com/@ClodomirVianna/infinite-snake)

## Manual

Use the arrow keys (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`) or `W` `A` `S` `D` to navigate the snake up, down, left, or right. Eat the red dot to gain points. If the snake collides with the wall or its own tail, it's game over. Press `ENTER` to restart, and `Q`, `ESCAPE` or `CTRL` + `C` to quit the game.
